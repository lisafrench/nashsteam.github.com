<h2>Ladies Hack Day (May 11th 2013)</h2>

<p>Ladies' Hack day is a day for women of all skill levels and ages to get together and build something radical. If you’ve *never* written a line of code in your life, but you want to learn, we want you here! If you’re a super awesome programmer who knows more about compilers than Grace Hopper, we’re honored to have you. You’ll leave with a fully functioning project that you can call your own.

We'll provide coffee, tea, lunch, and cupcakes. You provide your awesome self.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>

<p>Nashville Women's STEAM group is a collective of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math that want to further the community and increase the participation of women.</p>

<h3>Why??</h3>

<p>We started because we recognized a gap in between the existing community and the women that wish to join it.</p>

<p>We want to create a safe space for women to join these fields that we love so well.</p>

<h3>Ethos</h3>

<p>These are the philosophy behind our group (borrowed from the Hacker School code of conduct).  Please respect them when you attend our events.</p>

<ul>
  <li>No Saying "Well, Actually"</li>
  <li>No Feigning Suprise</li>
  <li>No Backseat Driving</li>
  <li>No Subtle Sexism, Racism, Or Any Discrimination</li>
</ul>
