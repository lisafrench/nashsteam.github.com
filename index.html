            <h3>Nashville Ladies' Hack Day</h3>

              <p>Our first Nashville Ladies' Hack Day was held on Saturday, May 11th, 2013. This hack day was organized by Nashville Women's STEAM Group Founder, Martha Kelly Girdler. Ladiesâ€™ Hack Day was a day for women and girls (and men and boys) to come together and celebrate women in computing. We offered a beginner course in HTML, another beginner course in JavaScript, and an advanced course in Python and using the command line interface. We also had a separate Minecraft track to learn about modding Minecraft!

            <h3>Who we are</h3>

              <p>Nashville Women's STEAM group is a collective of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math that want to further the community and increase the participation of women.</p>

            <h3>Why??</h3>

              <p>We started because we recognized a gap in between the existing community and the women that wish to join it.</p>

              <p>We want to create a safe space for women to join these fields that we love so well.</p>

            <h3>Ethos</h3>

              <p>These are the philosophy behind our group (borrowed from the <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/manual#sec-environment">Hacker School code of conduct</a>).  Please respect them when you attend our events.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>No Saying "Well, Actually"</li>
                  <li>No Feigning Suprise</li>
                  <li>No Backseat Driving</li>
                  <li>No Subtle Sexism, Racism, Or Any Discrimination</li>
                </ul>
